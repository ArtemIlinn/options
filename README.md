# :feather: System of Options Pricing and Trading.

The objective of this project is to describe how the pricing, valuation, and risk management of vanilla stock options , as well as to present software, so that the approaches may be applied in practice. As a scientific task – after solving the problem of delta hedging, conducting computational experiments.

Project also includes OptionLib, which is package with operating functions for working with options, volatility surface construction, stochastic models, Black-Scholes, and more...
