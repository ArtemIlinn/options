# :feather: System of Options Pricing and Trading.

The objective of this project is to describe how the pricing, valuation, and risk management of vanilla stock options , as well as to present software, so that the approaches may be applied in practice. As a scientific task ‚Äì after solving the problem of delta hedging, conducting computational experiments.

Project also includes OptionLib, which is package with operating functions for working with options, volatility surface construction, stochastic models, Black-Scholes, and more...
